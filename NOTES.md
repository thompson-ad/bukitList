# Scaffolding Our Project

Our browser requests an `index.html` file when accessing our application. It specifies all of the files that are required and need to be downloaded.

The `div` tag included in the body is the DOM node where are react application will be rendered by react DOM.

The `src/` folder is where our applications will be built from.

To get everything bundled up and built to the public folder, we will need to set up webpack and our build process.
