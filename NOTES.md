# Scaffolding Our Project

Our browser requests an `index.html` file when accessing our application. It specifies all of the files that are required and need to be downloaded.

The `div` tag included in the body is the DOM node where are react application will be rendered by react DOM.

The `src/` folder is where our applications will be built from. It contains the `client` and the `server` directories.

To get the react app bundled up and built, we will need to set up webpack and our build process.
